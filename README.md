Dear Viewer,

Due to my ongoing academic examinations, I was able to partially complete this project within the given time frame.

📌 Project Status

✅ Frontend: Mostly completed

UI design

Routing

Sweets grid


Images

Login & Register pages

Frontend UI: ~80% complete

✅ Backend: Fully functional and tested

APIs

Authentication

Database operations

Backend: ~90% complete

⚠️ Integration:

Frontend and backend integration is partially complete

🛠 Tech Stack

Frontend: React, CSS

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: MongoDB

Authentication: JWT▶️ How to Run the Frontend on Your Machine

Follow the steps below to run the frontend part of the Sweet Shop Management System locally.

✅ Prerequisites

Make sure the following are installed on your system:

Node.js (v16 or above recommended)
👉 Download from: https://nodejs.org

npm (comes with Node.js)

A code editor like VS Code

To verify installation, run:

node -v
npm -v

📁 Step 1: Clone the Repository
git clone <your-repository-url>


Navigate into the frontend folder:

cd sweet-shop-frontend


(Use the correct folder name if different.)

📦 Step 2: Install Dependencies
npm install


This will install all required packages listed in package.json.

▶️ Step 3: Start the Frontend Server
npm start


or (if using Vite):

npm run dev

🌐 Step 4: Open in Browser

Once the server starts, open your browser and visit:

http://localhost:3000


(or the port shown in the terminal, usually 5173 for Vite)

🔗 Backend Connection (Important)

Ensure the backend server is running before using full functionality.

API base URL is configured in the frontend (e.g., http://localhost:5000).

If needed, update API URLs inside:

services/

api/

or .env file

Example .env:

REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000

⚠️ Common Issues & Fixes

Port already in use → Close other running servers

API not working → Check backend is running

Blank page → Run npm install again and restart

📌 Note

Frontend integration with backend is partially completed due to academic time constraints. UI components and routing are functional.
🤖 Use of AI Tools

This project was developed with the assistance of AI-based tools as a learning and productivity aid.

How AI Was Used

To understand concepts related to the project (e.g., application flow, backend logic, database structure).

To get guidance on fixing errors, debugging issues, and understanding error messages.

To help with code structuring, naming conventions, and best practices.

To assist in writing documentation such as this README file.

How AI Was NOT Used

AI was not used to blindly generate the entire project.

All code was reviewed, understood, and modified manually.

Final implementation decisions, logic, and testing were done by me.

Learning Outcome

Using AI helped me:

Improve my understanding of full-stack development concepts

Learn how to debug and optimize code effectively

Work more efficiently while still maintaining academic integrity

This project reflects my own learning and effort, with AI used only as a supporting tool, similar to documentation or online references.
